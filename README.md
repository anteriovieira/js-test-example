# js-test-example

This is an example repo for [my newsletter](http://kcd.im/news) to show the
progression of JavaScript tests to give you an idea of what a test really is and
how frameworks fit into the mix.

This doesn't not show you the normal setup for a project! I do a few weird
config things to make it work well for this project.

Here's how you run the tests:

1. `node 1`
2. `node 2`
3. `node 3`
4. `node 4`
5. `npm run test`

You can also run all the tests with `npm run test:all`
